##Clustering

It is combining locations of close proximity into clusters, and simplify the display of markers on the map.

There a number on a cluster indicates how many locations it contains. You can click on each cluster and map zooms into that location and cluster splits into smaller clusters or individual location.

You can also zoom into any of the cluster locations, the number on the cluster decreases, and you begin to see the individual location on the map. Zooming out of the map consolidates the locations into clusters again.
